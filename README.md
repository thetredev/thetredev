# Hi!

I'm Timo, an IT systems & software enthusiast from Germany with a never ending cup of curiosity.


## About me

- üè´ Graduated from [Reutlingen University](https://www.reutlingen-university.de/) with a Bachelor of Science
- üíº Currently working as IT Manager R&D at [Corscience GmbH & Co. KG](https://www.corscience.com) helping the R&D department get things done outside of their realm of responsibilities like CI/CD and infrastructure work
- ‚ù§Ô∏è I love writing code, especially Python and Go
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Passionate about Linux, DevOps and container technologies
- üí¨ Got questions? [Ask!](https://github.com/thetredev/thetredev/issues)


## Experience

- **Having fun!** - when I have fun doing something I'm much more into it and can be much more efficient. I make sure I never forget that.
- **Software development**: mostly Python and Go. C/C++ not so much, but I can get around. I'm curious about new stuff coming out and always willing to learn other languages and/or different ways to go about developing software.
- **Software deployment**: GitLab CI/CD, GitHub workflows, packaging software (deb, rpm, ...)
- **DevOps - to a point**:
    - **Docker/Podman**: building images, running containers, Compose deployments, networking, you name it
    - **Kubernetes**: Setting up bare metal clusters using [k0s](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s), Helm, ArgoCD. I'm more Dev than Ops, so RBAC is still on my TODO list :)

In that order.
